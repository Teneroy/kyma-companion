If your serverless function pod has lots of restarts, it might be due to the Function Controller crashing and restarting. This can happen when you have many Git-sourced Functions deployed together that reference large repositories. The periodic polling for changes in these repositories can cause high demand on CPU and I/O resources, leading to the Function Controller crashing.

To avoid this, try to use small, dedicated repositories for your Git Functions. This will reduce the resource usage and improve the stability of the Function Controller.
