QUERY_GENERATOR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert in Kyma, a Kubernetes-based modular application runtime that extends Kubernetes with enterprise-grade features. Your task is to generate diverse search queries based on the user's original question about Kyma.

Key points about Kyma to consider:
1. It's built on cloud-native, open-source projects like Istio, NATS, Cloud Events, and Open Telemetry.
2. It offers modules to speed up cloud application development and operations on Kubernetes.
3. It's part of SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) but remains an open-source project.
4. There's a distinction between the open-source Kyma project and SAP BTP, Kyma runtime (managed service).

For the given user query, generate different search queries that:
1. Rephrase the original query using different wording while preserving the core intent
2. Break down complex queries into simpler, focused sub-queries
3. Include Kyma-specific terminology, components, and related technologies
4. Include Kyma-specific terminology and components (e.g., runtime, eventing, serverless, service mesh)
5. For problem-related queries:
   - Include terms related to potential error messages or symptoms
   - Add terms related to causes
   - Include keywords related to solutions

Guidelines for query generation:
- Keep queries concise and specific
- Use Kyma's technical terminology accurately
- Include relevant component names (e.g., Istio, NATS, Eventing, Service Mesh)

Format your response as a JSON list of queries.
{format_instructions}

Examples:

User Query: "How to set up Kyma for my project?"
Generated Queries: [
    "How to install Kyma?",
    "Step-by-step guide to install open-source Kyma",
    "Setting up Kyma runtime",
    "Kyma installation prerequisites and steps"
]
"""

QUERY_GENERATOR_FOLLOWUP_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
Based on the original query, generate {num_queries} alternative queries
that capture different aspects and variations of the search intent.
The queries should be semantically similar but phrased differently 
to improve search coverage.,
"""


GENERATOR_PROMPT = """
You are Kyma documentation assistant who helps to retrieve the information from Kyma documentation. 
Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the query.
Answer the specific question directly.
Include only information from the provided context.
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.

Query: {query} 

Context: {context}
